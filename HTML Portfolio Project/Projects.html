	<right><h4>Electroplating a Penny with Bismuth Crystals</h4></right>
	<p>I recently designed a new project that involves an acid-base neutralization reaction, a topic I learned about in my chemistry class. In this project, I created bismuth crystals from Pepto-Bismol. Bismuth subsalicylate is a primary ingredient in Pepto-Bismol which when broken down makes salicylic acid, a common pain reliever and anti-inflammatory. To isolate the bismuth atoms, I must create an acid-base neutralization reaction. This reaction combines Pepto-Bismol and diluted hydrochloric acid in order to create bismuth chloride, which can be changed into bismuth's metallic form by adding aluminum into the solution. After changing bismuth chloride to its metallic form and an excessive amount of filtering (Whatman paper and vacuum filtration), I was able to melt the bismuth turning it into a crystal. 
	Electroplating is the process of coating the surface of a conducting material with a metal. This is typically done by applying a current between the anode and cathode metal through an electrolyte.  This allows for the transfer of ions onto a metal surface, coating the surface with ions. In this part of the experiment, we attached a high voltage generator to anode and cathodes terminals (bismuth and penny, respectively) to run electricity through a high concentrated nitric acid solution (~18M). This allowed bismuth ions to transfer through the medium and onto the penny, effectively electroplating it.</p>

	<right><h4>Copper oxide and polyurethane-based capacitor</h4></right>
	<p>This energy storing device consists of a solar cell made up of copper oxide plates, and a polyurethane-graphene ink-based capacitor. This project aimed to create an efficient renewable energy-based battery. 
	The copper oxide solar panel is a photovoltaic: it takes in photons (light particles) and converts them into energy. The copper oxide panel allows photons to knock electrons free from their atoms, generating a flow of electricity. But how do we even make this panel? copper oxide is just a fancy term for burnt copper, which can be achieved by taking a copper sheet and burning it over a burner. We add an electrolyte salt (NaCl) to allow the electricity to flow to the other plate. Without salt the voltage output would be significantly less. This is because just water can’t carry the same amount of electricity as salt water. My super-capacitor consists of a graphene-polyurethane ink,  ground activated carbon, and a separator treated with 85% food grade phosphoric acid. Once all these materials are placed in the correct order we are able to make a consistent current with a battery to charge it.</p>
	<right><h4>Spiderman's Webshooters (ongoing)</h4></right>
	<p>Spiderman’s web-shooters is a device which allows the user to shoot synthetic spider silk in order to swing. My project tries to recreate the same effect by swinging by using compressed air canisters to ‘shoot’ grappling hooks in order to swing. There are many components involved in creating a web-shooter, such as solenoid valves, compressed air tanks, and Arduino's in order to shoot a web, and materials such as Dyneema rope, snap shackles, servo motors and aluminum plating. So far, I have completed the design of the web shooters, which includes a wrist mount and valve system. I have applied knowledge from my classes to complete these blueprints; for example, I used calculus to create a position-time graph to model the trajectory of the grappling hook and used physics to calculate the tensile strength of the string. I am in the process of creating a prototype for the web-shooter. I have also thought of other engineering concepts to my design, for example, creating a canister to hold multiple webs and grappling hooks to alternate between different types of materials (Dyneema string for swinging, regular string for webs).</p>
