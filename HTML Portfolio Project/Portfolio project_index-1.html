		<p> Hello! My name is Arnav Nanda and I am 18 years old. I am currently a Senior at Apex High School and plan to graduate in 2023. This year I am serving as the Head Captain of the Apex Robotics Team, and the Director of Logistics in Apex Model UN. I also participate in Science Olympiad and am part of Apex's Tennis Team. Other than school, I like to create new engineering projects and develop designs on CAD software such as Onshape and Fusion 360. Recently I have been designing Spider-Man's web shooter. These types of projects allow me to apply concepts that I learn from school, to create something new.After high school, I plan to go to a four year college and major in either biology or computer science. These two subject are very interesting as one teaches the intricacies of the human body, while the other delves deeper into the programming of electronic components. I am amazed by the complexity and the common use each of these subjects have. Specifically, I am amazed of how small electronic components are able to be programmed and made into something that is used in every day life. Even though I plan to major in biology or computer science, I want to continue to delve deeper into my studies so that I can find even more interesting topics.<br>
	 	I am applying to several colleges including Duke, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Charlotte, NC State, Georgia Tech, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, Yale, Harvard, and MIT (This list is subject to change). More specifically, I plan to apply as either a biomedical engineering major or an electrical engineering major and computer science minor. I chose these three subjects as possible fields of study as it directly reflects my interest in math, biology, and engineering. I have also taken many different steps to acquaint myself with each of these areas by participating in different programs, college level classes, and independent research. Some examples include participating in the Duke Research in Engineering program and Conrad challenge, working with Dr. Greenberg on the identification of cancerous locations in tissue, taking higher level math classes including Calculus III and Differential equations, and actively participating in Robotics. These activities have fueled my interest towards research, and have set a stage for me to pursue these interests in college. <br>
		I believe that my heavy course load and extensive involvement in extracurriculars like robotics and especially research at Duke university sets me apart from my peers. I have consistently given my best in and outside of the classroom regardless of the activity. I have taken higher level math classes which are not offered at my school and have gone out of my way to participate in research programs and internships. I have also given an introduction about the Conrad Challenge to the science department at Apex High to spread awareness about different STEM based competitions to the Apex High student community. I believe that I am a well rounded student and by taking rigorous college level courses, participating in research at a prestigious university like Duke and being placed in several research based competitions makes me an ideal candidate to apply for these schools. <br>
		As I have described above, I am extremely passionate about research in biotechnology and engineering. I have applied the knowledge that I have gained through clubs like Robotics, Science Olympiad, and higher level math and science classes to other activities and competitions that I have participated in.  I have also tried my best to apply research principles, which I learned from DukeREP and my internship with Dr. Greenberg, to further sharpen my investigative qualities necessary for pursuing a career in engineering and research. Other than Research I have also participated in STEM based competitions such as the CONRAD Challenge a STEM-based innovation and entrepreneurship challenge where students from all over the world present products that solve difficult STEM problems. My teammate and I created Tune, tunable autofocusing glasses for spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome. This competition has several research intensive rounds including the investors pitch, business plan, and a final presentation. Throughout these rounds, I created CAD models to show the function and relevance of my product and wrote a patent application covering all the aspects of this invention. The last round of the Conrad challenge required a lot of preparation and practice, to refine and develop our product and pitch for the judges. We ended up winning the Conrad Virtual Showcase and received positive feedback, new ideas, and business strategies for our product. Overall, I completely immerse myself in whatever activity I do, whether it is sports, extracurricular activities or academics.I am a maker; I like applying my classroom knowledge to create something that seems out of reach.

<p> 
	This fall I will be starting as a freshman in the Pratt school of engineering at Duke University. I plan to major in Biomedical and Electrical engineering with a minor in computer science. Participating in programs like Duke Research in Engineering Program (Duke REP) and working at the research lab of my mentor, Dr. Joel Greenberg at Duke University throughout high school left a significant impact on me and motivated me to pursue undergraduate study in this area. At Duke, I hope to follow my passion and also make an impact on local as well as global communities. <br>
	Apex High School has been a greate experience for myself and has introduced me to a lot of new people from different backgrounds. I have learned a lot about differnet concepts and communities and hope to continue that in college. At Duke, I plan to major in Electical and Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering and plan to participate in many engineering related clubs including, Duke Motorsport, Duke Electric Vehicles and Duke Robotics. I can not wait for this next chapter of my life and hope to ahve a lot of fun!
